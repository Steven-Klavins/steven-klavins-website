### About 

This repo holds the code for my personal portfolio website, it is built with a combination of React, Javascript, NodeJS/ParticleJS, CSS, and HTML. The purpose of this project is to exhibit my skills as a developer whilst also providing a good user experience.

I have yet to deploy this site however when its up a link will be provided.

### Future changes

At present my website is not optimized for mobile use, however this is something I intend to do in the near future.

### Animation

The majority of animation on the site was achieved with Framer Motion. This includes component transitions, the blinking cursor animation on the welcome page, and the message animation on the contact page. The animated background was created with particle JS and CSS.

### API

On the projects page, I used a combination of GitHub's API and Axios to pull in information about my repositories. I originally intended to use GitHub's GraphQL API however this added an unnecessary layer of complexity to the project. To avoid the hassle of dealing with authentication and environment variables I decided to use GitHub's API V3.
