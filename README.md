# Steven Klavins Website

**About**
This project is incomplete at present however still being worked on daily.

This repo holds the code for my personal portfolio website, it is built with a combination of React, Javascript, NodeJS/ParticleJS, CSS, and HTML. The purpose of this project is to exhibit my skills as a developer whilst also providing a good user experience.

I have yet to deploy this site however when its up a link will be provided.
