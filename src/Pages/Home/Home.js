        <p>
          Thank you for visiting my site! My name is Steven (most people call me
          Steve) and I'm a full-stack developer with a yearning to grow and
          learn. I'll just cut to the chase, tech is basically my life. The
          endless growth and potential tech has to make the world a better place
          is what gets me out of bed in the morning.
