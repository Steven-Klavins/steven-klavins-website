              Welcome and thank you for visiting my website! I'm a full-stack
              developer, Makers Academy graduate, and tech addict. I hold a BA
              in Digital Arts, perform in a band, and have a love of all things
              creative. I yearn to make the world a better place through
              innovative tech, to be frank, its what gets me out of the bed in
              morning. Â
